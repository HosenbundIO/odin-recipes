<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  My version of this classic Thai dish has spectacular taste even with regular
  basil instead of Thai or holy basil. The sauce actually acts like a glaze as
  the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or
  grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start
  cooking.

<p>
  Thai basil chicken is a stir-fry dish made with finely chopped or ground
  chicken cooked with chile peppers, garlic, and shallots, and seasoned with a
  sweet and salty sauce and finished with fresh basil. It's a classic dish in
  Thai cuisine and can be found in restaurants and as a popular street food
